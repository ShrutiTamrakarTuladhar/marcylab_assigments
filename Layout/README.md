<h1>HTML/CSS Layout Challenge</h1>

Your challenges is to recreate this mockup (Links to an external site.) using HTML and CSS. You are not allowed to use CSS frameworks such as bootstrap. You are not allowed to use JavaScript frameworks such as React or Angular. This challenge is designed for you to reinforce the fundamentals that all of these frameworks are built upon.

There are two versions of the mock webpage included: a desktop and a mobile version. For this challenge, you must build a working desktop version. For extra credit, make your design responsive, so that it matches the mobile design in small viewports.

You may use lorem ipsum text and grab placeholder images from placeholder.com (Links to an external site.). We're most concerned with the layout being nearly identical. Of course, if you want to make the design and content your own, go ahead!

Hints:

The key features of this layout that must be replicated are the navbar, header, and two-column section at the bottom of the page.
As the page size grows and shrinks, the navbar, header, and two-column sections should grow and shrink with it (take up all horizonatally avaliable space).
Ensure that you are rendering has one narrow column and one wide column (and you use flexbox to achieve this effect! ðŸ˜‰) 
Look at the border-radius property if you are stuck on how to make a picture round.
There should be no floats.
